                    <h2 class="h2ding">What are Constraints in Software Architecture?</h2>
                        <p class="pgraph">Constraints are fixed design restrictions put in place by the stakeholders and users. This amounts to
                            features that the developers must include and the requirements they must adhere to when they are developing software or hardware. </p>
                        <p class="pgraph">They are critical to software development as they make sure that the architecture is built on top of the listed contraints,
                            and they cannot be changed without breaking the necesary requirements. </p>

                    <h2 class="h2ding">How are Constraints established? </h2>
                    <p class="pgraph">Constraints are established by stakeholders and Project Delivery Leads. They "constrain" developments by enforcing some of
                        the requirements that a piece of software must contain.  </p>
                    <p class="pgraph">An example of a technical constraint may be "Programming Language".  It may be specified, for instance, that "This system must 
                        be built in Java". This is different to a functional requirement, as with a functional requirement, the developers must implement a feature,
                        but they have the freedom to chose how they do it. Constraints tell the developers <b> HOW </b> they need to implement the feature. </p>
                            
                    <h2 class="h2ding">Technical Constraints vs Business Constraints </h3>
                    <p class="pgraph">There are two types of Constraints in Software Development: Those that are Technical, and those that are Business - oriented. </p>
                    <dlv class="desct">
                        <dt>Technical Constraints </dt>
                        <dd>Technical constraints relate to design decisions that are architectural drivers for what is being developed. 
                            They define how something must be developed, and
                            they can be defined by the design team if they wish to simplify the scope on what they are developing (Oussalah 2013). </dd>

                        <dd> Some examples of technical constraints may be: </dd>
                        <ul> 
                            <li> Programming Language - What language MUST the code be written in </li>
                            <li> Platforms supported - What platforms MUST the system/software support </li>
                            <li> UI Elements required - What User Interface (UI) Elements MUST be shown on the screen </li>
                        </ul>

                        <dt>Business Constraints </dt>
                        <dd>Business Constraints relate to decisions that restrict software architecture design. They are not related to the development of the software
                            itself, but are restrictions in place to the resources that a development team has available to them (Keeling 2014). </dd>
                        <dd> Some examples of technical constraints may be: </dd>
                        <ul>
                            <li> Schedule/Time costraints - How much time a development goal MUST be met by  </li>
                            <li> Budgeting - How much money is available to the team to develop a specific component </li>
                            <li> Software Licensing - The software that is available for the team to use in development </li>
