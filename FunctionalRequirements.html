                    <h2 class="h2ding">What are Functional Requirements in Software Architecture? </h2>
                        <p class="pgraph">Functional requirements are all about the product features that must be implemented so that the user can achieve their goals!
                            They are important for defining how the system should behave given a condition! (Nuclino 2023) </p>
                        <p class="pgraph">Functional requirements are not the same as other types of requirements, such as Business requirements or user requirements.
                            Their main purpose is to describe to the developers how the system should operate based on how a user will interact with the system.  </p>

                    <h2 class="h2ding"> How Are Functional Requirements Written? </h2>
                    <p class="pgraph">Functional Requirements are a crucial element of Agile Development. They help teams with following a plan of 
                        what elements they need to develop so that the system does what it is expected to.  </p>
                    <p class="pgraph"> Functional Requirements are written as a part of a user story. A User Story is a key component of Agile Development,
                        where it tells the developer what a specific kind of user should be able to do and why they need that functionality. 
                        Keep reading below to learn about how Functional Requirements are written with User Stories.  </p>
                            
                    <h2 class="h2ding"> But first, what is Agile Development? </h3>
                    <p class="pgraph">Agile development is a conceptual framework for Software Engineering that involves creating development goals and
                        planning the road ahead to meet them! It involves a life-cycle process where there are goals and requirements that 
                        a team of developers needs to meet, but it is flexible and allows changes to be made in terms of what needs to be developed
                        and at what time.

                    </p>
                    <p class="pgraph">The most common component of an Agile Development is that of <b>User Stories</b>. A <b\>User Story</b> is a way of writing out any type 
                        of requirement in a business context, so that the developers can understand how to implement that functionality. The general format for 
                    a user story is as follows:  </p>
                    <p class="pgraph">As a (user type), I want to (function) so that (benefit).</user></p>
                    <p class="pgraph">An example of a user story written for a functional requirement may be the following: 
                        <p class="pgraph"> "As an existing user, I want to be able to save my credit card details so I can easily make future purchases." </p>

                    </p>
                    <p class="pgraph"> <b> The Functional Requirements of this user story may look like this: </b>
                    </p>
                    <h4> Functional Requirements:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="lsts"> The system must allow users to enter in their credit card details in their account by filling in the relavent fields. </li>
                        <li class="lsts"> The system must allow the user to save their credit card details by clicking on "Save Credit Card Details". </li>
                        <li class="lsts"> The system must allow the user to remove their saved credit card details by clicking on "Delete Credit Card" from a list
                            of saved credit cards.  </li>
