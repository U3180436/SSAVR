                    <p class="paragraph">This webpage discusses functional requirements in software architecture. 
                        It explains that functional requirements are product features that must be implemented to enable 
                        users to achieve their goals. The page notes that functional requirements are different from other 
                        types of requirements and are crucial elements of Agile Development. It further explains that functional
                         requirements are written as a part of a user story, which is a key component of Agile Development. 
                         The webpage provides an example of a user story and the functional requirements associated with it.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph">This webpage discusses Quality Attribute Requirements (QAR) or Non-Functional Requirements, 
                        which are used to validate Functional Requirements in Agile Development. QAR provides context behind different
                         aspects of each functional requirement, and there are several main quality attributes such as availability, 
                         interoperability, modifiability, performance, security, testability, usability, and scalability. 
                         QAR can relate to Agile Development through the different requirements that need to be met to 
                         achieve a functional requirement.</p>

                    <p class="garamond">Constraints</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">This webpage explains what constraints are in software architecture, which are fixed 
                        design restrictions put in place by stakeholders and users. They are critical to software development, 
                        as they ensure that the architecture is built on top of the listed constraints and cannot be changed 
                        without breaking the necessary requirements. Constraints can be technical or business-oriented and are 
                        established by stakeholders and project delivery leads. Technical constraints relate to design decisions 
                        that are architectural drivers, while business constraints relate to decisions that restrict software 
                        architecture design due to the resources available to the development team.</p>

                    <p class="garamond">Quality Attribute Scenarios</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">This webpage discusses the importance of measuring software quality and how it is 
                        affected by software architecture. Software quality attributes describe a system's intended behavior
                        within the environment for which it was built and provide a means of measuring the fitness and 
                        suitability of a product. Quality attributes must be described in terms of scenarios to provide 
                        quantifiable arguments about a system. Scenarios help describe the qualities of a system, but 
                        architectural tactics describe how a given quality can be achieved. The webpage emphasizes the 
                        importance of identifying desired system qualities before a system is built to select or create 
                        the right architecture. </p>
